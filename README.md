# NHB_demo_GSR

How to use the demo

1. Unpack the archive to your Matlab folder and go into it.

2. Unpack the PsPM toolbox.

3. If your Matlab version is lower than 2017, open the file GSR_data_processing_RT_demo.m and modify line 86: delete the option 'Autoupdate', 'off' from the legend definition. Save.

4. Open the GSR_exp_demo.m file

5. Run the file cell by cell by going into each cell qnd pressing Ctrl+Enter. When prompted to overwrite, respond "yes".

6. You will see a lot of output figures. This is how it was during the experiment: the figures were there to monitor the quality of the real-time updates. Just close them after inspecting to see the main plot.
